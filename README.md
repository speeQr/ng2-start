# ng2-start

This is the barebones Angular 2 starter based on the Scotch.io tutorials

## Installation
Run `npm install` in the root folder to install all dependencies

## Lite server

Run `npm start` to fire up the local server at port 3000

## app

The app folder is already created with an app-module and an app-component to allow for quick bootstrapping.
`app-root` is the root component selector.
